# belly-button-challenge

# Overview
This project utilizes Javascript and plotly library to create a dashboard of belly button bacteria. There were 660 randomized participants in this study exploring the microbiome of human navels. 

# Design
Javascript creates an important layer of abstraction for interacting with the study. This is especially true for stakeholders that might be disgusted by images of pitridish cultures and swabs. The dropdown menu shows clear diversity among samples, updating dynamically for each participant. The bar chart shows the top ten bacteria present while the bubble chart is comprehensive. 

# Process
The dropdown menu was developed with the help of a tutor, Justin Moore, because I didn't understand the event listener was already in the html. You'll also notice there was a forced commit to a previous version of the javascript, this was necessary while working with the TA to populate a working gitpage link. 

# Further Exploration
-Within the demographic information the "bbtype" and "wfreq" don't have clear meaning. I would adjust those based on my audience.
-While there is decent heirarchy for the fonts in size, I'd want to explore a styles for more branded storytelling as well.
-Based on context, I'd be curious if we need to flag any outliers based on a "healthy" range.
-I would also like to add a third visual that shows trends for the entire dataset. Another great options would be a window to compare two participants.
